    <description><![CDATA[Automated sewer defect detection has advanced through deep learning, particularly supervised methods using CCTV images, but based on large annotated datasets. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to reduce labeling demands. The method comprises self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled images using SwAV (Swapping Assignments between multiple Views) followed by fine-tuning for multi-label classification. Experiments on the Sewer-ML dataset demonstrate that the SSL approach, trained on only 35k labeled images, achieves an F1-score of 69.11%, and F2CIW of 54.22%, surpassing the fully supervised baseline trained from scratch on 1.04 million images. Increasing the unlabeled pre-training data further enhances performance, while ImageNet initialization consistently outperforms training from scratch. Self-supervised learning also helps mitigate the effects of mislabeled data, which is observed to be present even in the Sewer-ML ground truth. Overall, self-supervised learning provides an accurate, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to fully supervised approaches, particularly in data-scarce or imperfectly labeled scenarios.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Information exchange between Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools is challenging, since many applications use their own native data formats. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema, an open data exchange format for BIM, does not capture the full semantic meaning needed for direct use by different BIM tools and can be prone to information loss due to reduction, simplification, translation and interpretation of the data. Current practice often treats the imported model as a reference and requires a user to remodel the building using the respective application’s native elements. Many BIM object properties are defined by its classification. Inconsistencies in the mapping between native BIM elements and IFC, e.g. due to unsupported export functionality or manual error, can lead to problems when using the model in a downstream application. Recent works demonstrate that neural networks offer a promising possibility to alleviate this issue via classification of the objects contained in a BIM model and suggesting those corrections to the user. However, the computational overhead of these deep learning models, either due to necessary pre-processing of the data or runtime performance of the model, makes it difficult for them to be used in plug-ins or middleware for BIM tools. This work proposes SpaRSE-BIM, a neural network model based on sparse convolutions for the classification of IFC-based geometry and semantic enrichment of BIM models. Experiments are performed on two IFC entity classification benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that SpaRSE-BIM is significantly more efficient at inference time compared to previous approaches, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. Further experiments explore the applicability of IFC entity classification datasets to the domain of Scan-to-BIM. It can be shown that the feature space of SpaRSE-BIM learns to discern objects in a semantically meaningful way, even in cases where fine-grained subtype information for IFC objects is not available during training.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multiagent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool’s APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting. The code is open source.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.

    <description><![CDATA[The adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and model-based design within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry has been hindered by the perception that using BIM authoring tools demands more effort than conventional 2D drafting. To enhance design efficiency, this paper proposes a BIM command recommendation framework that predicts the optimal next actions in real-time based on users’ historical interactions. We propose a comprehensive filtering and enhancement method for large-scale raw BIM log data and introduce a novel command recommendation model. Our model builds upon the state-of-the-art Transformer backbones originally developed for large language models (LLMs), incorporating a custom feature fusion module, dedicated loss function, and targeted learning strategy. In a case study, the proposed method is applied to over 32 billion rows of real-world log data collected globally from the BIM authoring software Vectorworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can learn universal and generalizable modeling patterns from anonymous user interaction sequences across different countries, disciplines, and projects. When generating recommendations for the next command, our approach achieves a Recall@10 of approximately 84%.

    <description><![CDATA[Building information modeling (BIM) has become prevalent in construction engineering management. However, the efficiency of traditional file-based BIM exchange between multidisciplinary teams remains low due to the transmission of redundant data from mostly unchanged BIM objects. Additionally, the traceability of changes between BIM files is limited. This paper proposes a traceable semantic differential transaction (tSDT) approach for open BIM exchange, which minimizes data redundancy and enables semantic-level traceability of BIM changes. Furthermore, openBIMdisk implements the tSDT and provides a Blockchain 3.0 virtual disk to support efficient, traceable, and secure BIM exchanges across multiple blockchain services. A pilot study of a modular construction project demonstrated the effectiveness of tSDT and open-BIMdisk. Experimental results indicated that tSDT achieved minimal BIM redundancy for storing and restoring all BIM changes, using a sheer 0.007% of disk space on average. openBIMdisk facilitated BIM version management and object-level semantic traceability with a response time of 5.3 ms. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, tSDT offers a novel and efficient approach for semantic BIM change traceability. Second, openBIMdisk provides BIM practitioners with a Blockchain 3.0 application featuring intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for BIM exchange.]]></description>
