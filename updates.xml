    <description><![CDATA[As-designed building information models (BIM) often diverge from as-built conditions, limiting their reliability during the operation and maintenance (O&M). Current research focuses on change detection but lacks a systematic workflow for reliable updates, especially for piping systems with frequent changes and complex geometries. The paper addresses how to establish a semi-automated, end-to-end workflow for localised updating as-designed BIM of piping systems from point cloud data. The workflow applies PointNet++ for segmentation, followed by iterative closest point, random sample consensus, and region-growing for geometry extraction. The proposed BIM updating taxonomy and dedicated pre-judgment updating requirements (PUR) and spatial and topological relationships up-dating (STRU) algorithms identify update requirements and automate parametric updates. Validation through case studies demonstrates the workflow's ability to accurately perform localised updates, reducing the manual workload by approximately 70 %. This practical, scalable solution strengthens O&M by maintaining accurate as-built models and inspires future automated BIM updating research.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This study aims to improve post-disaster preliminary damage assessment (PDA) using artificial intelligence (AI) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. In particular, a stacked convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is introduced and trained on an in-house visual dataset from Hurricane Dorian. To account for the ordinality of damage level classes, the cross-entropy classification loss function is replaced with the square of earth mover's distance (EMD2) loss. The trained model achieves 65.6% building localization precision and 61% (90% considering ±1 class deviation from ground-truth) classification accuracy. It also exhibits a positive accuracy–confidence correlation, which is valuable for model assessment in situations where ground-truth information is not readily available. Finally, the outcome of damage assessment is compared with the literature by examining the relationship between building size and number of stories, and severity of induced disaster damage.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Bridge maintenance knowledge graphs (BMKGs) contain rich historical records of defects and corresponding maintenance actions, yet few studies exploit this data to guide decisions for new defects. Traditional case-based reasoning (CBR) methods can surface similar historical cases but suffer from high retrieval costs and struggle with ambiguous scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper introduces BMKG-DCoT, which integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to mimic maintenance expert decision workflows. BMKG-DCoT follows a three-phase iterative process—Inference-Planning (formulating reasoning steps and retrieval plans), Interaction-Decision (targeted data extraction from the BMKG), and Observation-Judgment (evaluating and refining inferences). On some standard and ambiguous maintenance queries, BMKG-DCoT achieves F1 scores of 0.9529 and 0.9130, respectively, outperforming baselines. Explainability analyses further confirm that its reasoning paths are transparent and interpretable, underscoring its promise as an AI-driven decision-support tool for bridge maintenance.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Changing climatic conditions are contributing to faster deterioration of building fabric. Increasing number of heavy rainfall events can particularly affect historic and Cultural Heritage (CH) buildings. These evolving and uncertain circumstances demand more frequent survey of building fabric to ensure satisfactory repair and maintenance. However, traditional fabric surveys have been shown to lack efficiency, accuracy and objectivity, hindering essential repair operations. The recent development of reality capture technologies, together with the development of algorithms to effectively process the acquired data, offers the promise of transformation of surveying methods. This paper presents an original algorithm for automatic segmentation of individual masonry units and mortar regions in digitised rubble stone constructions, using geometrical and colour data acquired by Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) devices. The algorithm is based on the 2D Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), and uniquely it does not require the wall to be flat or plumb. This characteristic is important because historic structures, in particular, commonly present non-negligible levels of bow, waviness and out-of-verticality. The method is validated through experiments undertaken using data from two relevant and highly significant Scottish CH buildings. The value of such segmentation to building surveying and maintenance regimes is also further demonstrated with application in automated and accurate measurement of mortar recess and pinning. Overall, the results demonstrate the value of the automatic segmentation of masonry units towards more comprehensive and accurate surveys.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Construction quality and progress control are demanding, yet critical construction activities. Building Information Models and as-built scanned data can be used in Scan-vs-BIM processes to effectively and comprehensively support these activities. This however requires accurate registration of scanned point clouds with 3D (BIM) models. Automating such registration remains a challenge in the context of the built environment, because as-built can be incomplete and/or contain data from non-model objects, and construction buildings and other structures often present symmetries and self-similarities that are very challenging to registration.  In this paper, we present a novel automatic coarse registration method that is an adaptation of the ‘4 Points Congruent Set’ algorithm to the use of planes; we call it the ‘4-Plane Congruent Set’ (4-PlCS) algorithm. The approach is further integrated in a software system that delivers not one but a ranked list of the most likely transformations, so to allow the user to quickly select the correct transformation, if need be. Two variants of the method are also considered, in particular one in the case when the vertical axis is known a priori; we call that method the 4.5-PlCS method. The proposed algorithm is tested using five different datasets, including three simulated and two real-life ones. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where the correct transformation always ranks very high (in our experiments, first or second), and is extremely close to the ground-truth transformation. Experimental comparison of the proposed approach with a standard, more intuitive approach based on finding 3-plane congruent sets shows the discriminatory power of 4-plane bases over 3-plane bases, albeit at no clear benefits in terms of computational time. The experimental results for the 4.5-PlCS method show that it delivers a non-negligible reduction in computational time (approx. 20%), but at no additional benefit in terms of effectiveness in finding the correct transformation.]]></description>
