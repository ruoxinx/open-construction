    <description><![CDATA[Traditional building energy modeling with the EnergyPlus building performance simulation engine requires domain expertise, programming skills, and intensive manual efforts limiting its effective adoption. This paper introduces EnergyPlus-MCP, the first open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server specifically designed for EnergyPlus simulation workflows, establishing a new foundational infrastructure for AI-driven building energy modeling. The MCP server implements a layered architecture with 35 specialized tools spanning model management, editing and analysis, HVAC and other systems configuration inspection, and simulation execution, enabling Large Language Models to interact with EnergyPlus through conversational interfaces. The server addresses critical workflow barriers by automating model validation, streamlining energy efficiency measures modification, and providing intelligent output management with interactive visualization. Through practical demonstrations using a multi-zone building retrofit analysis, we show how the EnergyPlus-MCP server significantly reduces manual efforts while maintaining full simulation rigor. By providing accessible natural language interfaces to sophisticated building energy analysis, this approach enables scalable deployment of simulation expertise across public and private organizations, educational institutions, and research teams, fundamentally transforming traditional building energy modeling practices.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Quality inspection during the production of modular construction (MC) is critical to the success of MC projects because defects such as geometric errors can severely impact installation. Therefore, the effective organization and management of quality inspection is essential. Although work packaging has proven to be an effective method for project planning, automatically and accurately generating inspection work packages remains a challenge, particularly in mass production. To this end, this study aims to develop a knowledge graph-large language model (KG-LLM)-enabled inspection work packaging approach in MC production. First, a KG is constructed to represent inspection knowledge, encompassing inspection tasks, target MC products, inspectors, inspection tools, inspection frequencies, and corresponding production processes, which can enrich LLM in product2inspection mapping and can help identify features of inspection tasks for inspection2package clustering. Second, a prompt-based product2inspection mapping approach leveraging LLM is developed. Next, inspection2package clustering is completed through hierarchical agglomerative clustering, with parameters optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through controlled experiments on an MC case project. This study demonstrates how leveraging KG and LLMs can enhance collaboration in quality inspection during module prefabrication and highlights the potential of LLMs in the construction domain.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a time-consuming and complex process, requiring precise, long-horizon user interactions with intricate 3D interfaces. While recent advances in AI-driven user interface (UI) agents show promise, most existing datasets and methods focus on short, low-complexity tasks in mobile or web applications, failing to capture the demands of professional engineering tools. In this work, we introduce VideoCAD, the first attempt to model UI interactions for precision engineering tasks. Specifically, VideoCAD is a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video recordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for collecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs. Compared to existing datasets, VideoCAD offers an order-of-magnitude increase in complexity for real-world engineering UI tasks, with time horizons up to 20x longer than those in other datasets. We show two important downstream applications of VideoCAD: (1) learning UI interactions from professional 3D CAD tools for precision tasks and (2) a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models (LLMs) on spatial reasoning and video understanding. To learn the UI interactions, we propose VideoCADFormer, a state-of-the-art model for learning CAD interactions directly from video, which outperforms existing behavior cloning baselines. Both VideoCADFormer and the VQA benchmark derived from VideoCAD reveal key challenges in the current state of video-based UI understanding, including the need for precise action grounding, multi-modal and spatial reasoning, and long-horizon dependencies.]]></description>
