**OpenConstruction** is a **community-governed, open-source platform** that enables the
**distributed development, validation, and discovery** of datasets, AI models,
workflows, and open educational resources (OERs) for the
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) domain.

## Purpose

AI-ready resources in the AEC domain are often fragmented, inconsistently documented,
and difficult to reuse. OpenConstruction provides
**shared infrastructure, standards, and workflows** that support:

- Discoverability and comparison of AEC AI resources  
- Reproducible research and benchmarking  
- Community stewardship and long-term maintenance  
- Continuous, distributed platform development  

OpenConstruction **does not host datasets or models**. It indexes publicly available
resources and focuses on the **platform and standards** that make them reusable,
interoperable, and sustainable.


## Contribution Model
OpenConstruction follows a **distributed development model**. Anyone may participate by proposing contributions, reviewing changes, and helping
maintain both **the cataloged resources** and **the platform infrastructure**.

### Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:
- Adding or updating dataset, model, workflow, or OER entries
- Improving metadata schemas or validation scripts
- Developing platform modules (ingestion helpers, evaluators, benchmarks)
- Improving documentation, tooling, or onboarding materials

👉 See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for detailed contribution instructions.

## How to Contribute

1. Open an issue using the appropriate template.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
3. Add or modify files following schema and contribution standards.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) describing your changes.
5. Address review feedback; once approved, the PR is merged and credited.

All contributions undergo **peer review** and **automated CI checks**.


## Continuous Integration & Quality Assurance

All pull requests are validated through **CI/CD workflows**, including:
- JSON schema validation  
- Required metadata field checks  
- Lightweight link validation  
- Attribution and license checks  

These checks ensure that community contributions are
**consistent, interoperable, and sustainable**.


## Modular Extension System

OpenConstruction supports **community-maintained modules** that extend platform
capabilities.

Example module types include:
- Benchmark definitions and task packs
- Validation and enrichment utilities

Modules are registered and maintained
by contributors, enabling **co-development of platform capabilities**.


## Governance & Stewardship

The OpenConstruction ecosystem is sustained through **open, rotating,
community-driven roles**, including:

- **Core Maintainers** – platform-wide stewardship and governance
- **Module Maintainers** – oversight of specific catalogs or modules
- **Stewards & Reviewers** – quality assurance and contributor mentoring
- **Release Leads** – coordination of periodic releases and changelogs
- **Community Contributors** – anyone participating in development or review

👉 See **[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)** for full governance details.


## Licensing

OpenConstruction respects all intellectual property and does not redistribute
restricted or proprietary content.


## Acknowledgment

We thank the global community of researchers, educators, and practitioners whose
contributions advance open science and AI innovation in the AEC domain.
